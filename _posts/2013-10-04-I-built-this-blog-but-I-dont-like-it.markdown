	  <h2>Wow</h2>
	  <p>So I followed the tutorial I discovered at Eric Jones blog ("<a href="http://erjjones.github.io/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/">How I built my blog in one day</a>") thinking that it would yield a very nice, simple, direct coding blog here on github.</p>
	  <p>
	  Ugh.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Seriously, if this is the alternative then I'm not sure Wordpress has anything to worry about. Granted, this was an excellent educational experience, but beyond that, I'm not very impressed.
	  </p><p>
	  I have a basic blog, but it took hours to set-up, it doesn't look very good, and--apparently--I have to write posts for it in HTML.</p>
	  <p>
	  One of the reasons that Eric (? maybe it was someone else) gave for pursuing a non-Wordpress alternative was that he felt that using Wordpress ruined his coding "cachet."
	  </p><p>
	  Well, I guess I'm not too worried that someone is going to look at my Wordpress blog and think "oh, geez, who the heck is this guy--clearly he can't code." And if someone is dumb enough to think that, they're not someone I'm too interested in doing business with.</p><p>
	  I use Wordpress because, personally, I find it easy to create a nice looking, highly functional blog: one which is very easy to modify and change in any conceivable way, but also extremely efficient for blogging on.
	  </p><p>
	  Personally, I've never really understood all the furor over Wordpress. It seems to me to be much ado about nothing. I mean, do we really need Ghost? For those who don't know, Ghost is a minimalist blogging platform--created under the auspices that blogging on Wordpress is so tedious and difficult.
	  </p><p>
	  But for me, blogging on Wordpress is a cinch for my needs. And that's what I'm using. Simply writing this single post in HTML has been...well, gross. I avoid HTML even when coding because it's difficult to digest, and my fingers hate all the extra keystrokes. I use HAML, Slim, or Jade instead. I'd rather deal with their idiocyncrasies than wrangle HMTL. Yuck.
